# CIS-1051-Final-Project

# Preproposal

## What ideas do you have for your final project?

A website where a user can plug in different physics and engineering values such as distance, velocity, torque etc. and select a value they are looking for. Based on what the values the user plugs in the code will use the correct equations to get them their desired value.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I do not plan to work with other classmates

## Do you have any questions of your own? 

What are the best coding languages to use, other than python, to make a website? 

# Proposal

## What will be the title of your project?

Engineering Value Generator 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project.

A website that lets you find engineering and other math values based on given data.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project is going to be a website that allows the user to find a desired engineering or math value based on the input data they provide. My software will allow the user to select the value they are looking for, once they have done that they will be prompted to input all other required data. Using the data the user provides the software will use the correct equation to provide the user with their desired value. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course?

I do not plan to combine my final project with another course's final project.

## In a sentence, define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e, what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A good outcome would be getting a fully functional website up and working that provides the user with their desired value.

## In a sentence, define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e, what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outctome would be getting a fully functional website that provides the user their desired value and suggests other values that may be of use to the user. 

## In a sentence, define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e, what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be getting a fully functional website that provides the user their desired value, suggest other values that may be of use, is aesthetically pleaseing, and completely intuitive for the user. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?

My next step is to brush up on my knowledge of JavaScript. I believe I will be most successful in creating a website if I combine my knowledge of Python and JavaScript. After that I will research what values are most commonly used in the engineering field and what is the most efficient way of solving for those values. I will then begin creating code that is able to solve for different engineering equations. I am not working with any other students for this project so all this work will be done on my own.
